  <h2> Approach </h2>

This site is about trying to understand the complex world of human behavior and see if we can make sense of it using modern computational tools.

To that end, I'll be sharing articles that provide a foundation or an interesting perspective on understanding the world of psychology or behavior.

But massively complex questions create massive amounts of data. In order to make sense of it data scientists use computation tools.

Thus, I'll also be showing you how to use the tools to acquire, process, and analyze data into insights.
