- title: Python and Pandas
  content: "Once data sets get large, its time to start using a little bit of programming to help.
    Matlab, R, and Python are the most popular languages for scientific computing. I prefer Python
    and will teach how to solve data challenges using that, leveraging the Pandas and numpy libraries
    (Python add-on code that enhances Python's capabilities)."

- title: Terminal
  content: "One of the first things you have to be able to do in order to really
    get comfortable with data analysis is unlock the full power of your computer.
    On Macs, that means learning how to use the Terminal. I will be teaching you
    the most essential basics of how to use Terminal."

- title: Excel
  content: "The most basic computer tool to do data analysis is Microsoft Excel
    or Google Sheets. There is a LOT more power in these applications than simply
    making graphs. They are very useful for taking a quick snapshot on your data
    and doing sanity checks.

    Currently, Excel is much more full featured than Google Sheets, and I will be
    teaching mostly how to do tasks in Excel."

- title: Visualization Tools
  content: "Data visualizations are a key part of data analysis and communication.
    Visualizations help you spot check your data and present your data in a compelling
    way. I'll be teaching a variety of data visualization tools."

- title: Quality of Life / Workflow Tools
  content: "Analyzing and sharing data can be a complicated multiple step process.
    It can become real painful real quick to stay organized without help. These
    quality of life tools, such as Github, Atom, Trello, Asana, Jira, and Jupyter
    notebooks have become an integral part of my workflow, and let me get things
    done. I'll teach you how to use them too."
