meta: "The most basic computer tool to do data analysis is Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. There is a LOT more power in these applications than simply making graphs. They are very useful for taking a quick snapshot on your data and doing sanity checks.

Currently, Excel is much more full featured than Google Sheets, and I will be teaching mostly how to do tasks in Excel."
